A modular game engine made purely in python, why? because i like to suffer of course!
the modular in modular game engine comes from the fact that the entire engine is based on 1 base entity class en countless
components that you can add to them(kind of like unity) which makes the code a shit ton more readable, this whole project has
been made by me!
